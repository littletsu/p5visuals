# glitch visuals made in p5.js
highly inefficient & horrible code that i just played around with until i got a nice result so if you see weird stuff thats probably why<br><br>
used images for each frame of the videos instead of the actual videos because i couldnt figure out a way to make them display and be able to edit the pixels at the same time<br><br>
song is Dorencore - Flashing Lights Remix 5.0
